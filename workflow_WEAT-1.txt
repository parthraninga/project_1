WEAT-1: Implement Multi-City Weather Comparison Table
Description: Develop a comparison table allowing users to view weather metrics for 3+ cities simultaneously using OpenWeatherMap API data.

h4. *Acceptance Criteria*

✅ *Core Functionality (50%)*

* *+20%* Displays 3+ cities' data within 15 seconds
* *+20%* All columns show real API data (no mock values)
* *+10%* Maintains sort state during data refreshes

✅ *UX (30%)*

* *+15%* Clear visual differentiation between cities
* *+15%* Empty state when no cities selected

✅ *Innovation (20%)* _(Bonus)_

* *+10%* "Delta" mode showing differences from first city
* *+10%* Mini sparkline graphs for temp trends

Workflow:
**Task Breakdown & Workflow for WEAT-1: Implement Multi-City Weather Comparison Table**

---

### 1. **API Integration**
- Research OpenWeatherMap API endpoints for required weather metrics.
- Create utility functions to fetch weather data for multiple cities in parallel.
- Implement error handling and loading states.

### 2. **Table Component**
- Design and scaffold a responsive comparison table component.
- Map API data to table columns (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).
- Ensure support for 3+ cities dynamically.
- Implement sorting functionality on columns.

### 3. **Performance**
- Optimize data fetching to display all cities’ data within 15 seconds.
- Add loading indicators and timeout handling.

### 4. **Data Refresh & State Management**
- Implement periodic or manual data refresh.
- Maintain current sort state during refreshes.

### 5. **UX Enhancements**
- Apply clear visual differentiation (e.g., colors, borders, headers) between cities.
- Design and implement an empty state UI when no cities are selected.
- Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.

### 6. **Bonus Innovation Features**
- **Delta Mode:**  
  - Add toggle for "Delta" mode.
  - Calculate and display differences in metrics compared to the first city.
- **Mini Sparklines:**  
  - Integrate sparkline graphs for temperature trends in each city’s row.

### 7. **Testing & QA**
- Unit test data fetching and table rendering.
- Test sorting, empty state, and delta mode.
- Validate performance and UX acceptance criteria.

### 8. **Documentation**
- Update README with usage instructions and feature descriptions.
- Document API integration and any configuration steps.

**Workflow Summary:**
1. Set up API integration and data utilities.
2. Build and style the comparison table.
3. Implement sorting and data refresh logic.
4. Add visual differentiation and empty state.
5. Develop bonus features (delta mode, sparklines).
6. Test all features and edge cases.
7. Document usage and deployment steps.
8. Review, demo, and deploy.
