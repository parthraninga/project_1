WEAT-2: Implement Dynamic Weather Visualizations
Description: Create immersive weather representations through dynamic backgrounds and animated icons that reflect current conditions.

*Acceptance Criteria*

✅ *Core Visuals (50%)*

* *+25%* Background changes within 15 second of weather data load
* *+25%* Minimum 3 distinct weather animations implemented ( Falling Rain, Dynamic Cloud Movement, Sunny, Wind Gust Simulation, Thunderstorm Flash, Fog/Mist Diffusion Effect )

✅ *UX Polish (30%)*

* *+15%* Smooth transitions between states (e.g., sun → rain)
* *+15%* Adaptive contrast (dark text on light backgrounds)

✅ *Innovation (20%)* _(Bonus)_

* *+10%* Parallax layers (e.g., distant clouds move slower)
* *+10%* Sound effects synced to animations (e.g., thunder crack)

Workflow:
**WEAT-2: Implement Dynamic Weather Visualizations – Task Breakdown & Workflow**

---

### 1. **Preparation**
- [ ] Review weather data structure and available condition codes.
- [ ] Audit current UI for integration points (where backgrounds/icons are rendered).
- [ ] Gather or design assets for backgrounds and animated icons.

---

### 2. **Core Visuals (50%)**

**A. Dynamic Backgrounds (25%)**
- [ ] Set up logic to detect weather condition from loaded data.
- [ ] Implement background switching logic.
- [ ] Ensure background updates within 15 seconds of weather data load.
- [ ] Test with various weather conditions.

**B. Weather Animations (25%)**
- [ ] Choose and prioritize at least 3 distinct weather animations:
    - [ ] Falling Rain
    - [ ] Dynamic Cloud Movement
    - [ ] Sunny
    - [ ] Wind Gust Simulation
    - [ ] Thunderstorm Flash
    - [ ] Fog/Mist Diffusion Effect
- [ ] Implement selected animations as animated icons or overlays.
- [ ] Integrate animations with background and ensure correct display per condition.

---

### 3. **UX Polish (30%)**

**A. Smooth Transitions (15%)**
- [ ] Implement fade or crossfade transitions between weather states.
- [ ] Ensure transitions are smooth (no flicker, abrupt changes).
- [ ] Test with rapid weather changes.

**B. Adaptive Contrast (15%)**
- [ ] Implement logic to determine background brightness.
- [ ] Dynamically adjust text/icon color for readability (e.g., dark text on light background).
- [ ] Test for accessibility and contrast compliance.

---

### 4. **Innovation (20%) – Bonus**

**A. Parallax Layers (10%)**
- [ ] Add multiple background layers (e.g., foreground clouds, distant clouds).
- [ ] Implement parallax effect (distant layers move slower).
- [ ] Sync with animation frame updates.

**B. Synced Sound Effects (10%)**
- [ ] Source or create weather-related sound effects (rain, thunder, wind).
- [ ] Sync sound playback with corresponding animations (e.g., thunder sound on flash).
- [ ] Provide mute/volume controls.

---

### 5. **Testing & QA**
- [ ] Test all weather conditions for correct visuals and transitions.
- [ ] Test on multiple devices and screen sizes.
- [ ] Verify performance impact (animations, sounds).
- [ ] Collect feedback from team/stakeholders.

---

### 6. **Documentation & Handoff**
- [ ] Document animation and background logic.
- [ ] Note any configuration or asset requirements.
- [ ] Prepare release notes and demo for review.

---

**Workflow Summary:**
1. Prep assets and integration points.
2. Implement dynamic backgrounds and weather animations.
3. Polish transitions and adaptive contrast.
4. Add parallax and sound effects (bonus).
5. Test thoroughly.
6. Document and demo.

---

**Assign tasks to team members as appropriate.**
